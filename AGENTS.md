## Agent Rules (alwaysApply)


### Structure and Practices

- Node.js: version 22
- Package manager: `pnpm`
- Documentation:
  - Guides: `docs/`
  - Development stage docs: `dev_docs/`
  - Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for significant changes
  - README, all the documentation, jsdoc, messages and strings have to be in English
  - Do not use comments at the end of line. Use comments at the top of line
- Environment variables: `.env.production.example` is the source of truth for expected variables
